# -SOLUTION-TO-A-SYSTEM-OF-LINEAR-EQUATIONS
## Aim:
To write a python program to find a solution to a system of linear equations.
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2: Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array()
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.solve(), we can find the solutions.
### Step 4: End the program
## Program:

## Output:
## Result: 
Thus the solutions for the linear equations are successfully solved using python program
